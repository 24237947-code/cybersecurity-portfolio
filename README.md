* **Programming:** Python (Basic scripting), Bash.
* **Networking:** TCP/IP protocols, Subnetting, DNS, Firewalls.

## Certifications and Training
* **WQE7001 Cyber Security Course** - University of Malaya
* Attended: "Ethical Hacking Workshop 2025"

## Project Experience
### Project 1: Network Vulnerability Assessment
* **Objective: To identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities in a controlled lab network.
* **Tools Used: Nmap, Nessus.
* **Methodology:
    1.  Performed ping sweeps to identify active hosts.
    2.  Conducted aggressive scans (`nmap -A`) to detect OS and service versions.
    3.  Analyzed results to find outdated services.
* **Outcome: Successfully identified 3 critical vulnerabilities and recommended patch management strategies.

### Project 2: Password Strength Analysis Script
* **Objective: Develop a Python script to test password complexity against common policies.
* **Tools Used: Python, VS Code.
* **Methodology:
    1.  Wrote a function to check for length, special characters, and numbers.
    2.  Implemented a dictionary check against common weak passwords.
* **Outcome: Created a functional tool that rates password strength effectively.

## Learning Journey
Throughout the WQE7001 course, I have moved from basic IT knowledge to understanding complex security architectures.
* **Key Learnings: I have mastered the basics of cryptography and how encryption protocols secure data.
* **Challenges: Initially, understanding the intricacies of buffer overflow attacks was difficult.
* **Improvement Plan: I am currently practicing on "TryHackMe" platforms to improve my practical exploitation skills and reviewing memory management concepts.

## Career Objective
My goal is to become a Penetration Tester or SOC Analyst. I aim to work in a dynamic environment where I can utilize my analytical skills to detect threats and secure organizational infrastructure.
